# IF-ELSE-STATEMENT

AIM : To study and implement C++ decision making statements

SOFTWARE USED : VS CODE

THEORY : These C++ programs demonstrate basic concepts such as input/output handling, conditional statements, and switch-case structures. The first program checks whether a number is even or odd using the modulus operator %. The second identifies whether a given character is a vowel by comparing it with all vowels in both uppercase and lowercase. The third program finds the largest among three numbers using a series of if-else conditions. The fourth program takes a number input and displays the corresponding month name using a switch statement. The fifth is a simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on the userâ€™s choice, again using switch-case. Input is received through cin and output displayed with cout, enabled by including the <iostream> header and the using namespace std; directive. These programs help beginners understand the logic-building process and how to control the flow of execution using conditions and user inputs.

ALGORITHM : 

1. Even or Odd Program


Start

Declare an integer variable number

Input a number from the user

Check if number % 2 == 0

If true, print "The number is even"

Else, print "The number is odd"

Stop



2. Vowel or Consonant Program

   
Start

Declare a character variable ch

Input a character from the user

Check if ch is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u in both upper and lowercase)

If true, print "The character is a vowel"

Else, print "The character is a consonant"

Stop



3.Largest Among Three Numbers


Start

Declare three integer variables: num1, num2, and num3

Input all three numbers

Compare the values:

If num1 > num2 and num1 > num3, print "Num1 is the largest"

Else if num2 > num1 and num2 > num3, print "Num2 is the largest"

Else, print "Num3 is the largest"

Stop
